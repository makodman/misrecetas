                        <p>Japanese style Tattoo Artist based in Japan. Nakano was inspired when he saw a Japanese yakuza in a full suit of tattoos when he was around eleven or twelve. This inspired Nakano to visit legendary tattoo artist Yoshitsugu Muramatsu and got a tattoo from his son. Since then he became Muramatsu's apprentice at age 25. Horiyoshi III is the second tattooist be granted that honorific title, which passes from master to apprentice. The tattooist affixation Hori means to engrave or "to carve."Muramatsu bestowed this title upon Nakano in 1971.His wife, Mayumi Nakano, is the general manager of his public "Tattoo Museum" located close to the Yokohama Station, which he founded in 2000. At Horiyoshi's studio in Yokohama, Japan tattoos are outlined freehand using an electric needle. Shading and color is added using the traditional tebori, or Japanese hand tattooing, technique. He restricts his motifs to the classical repertoire of the vast variety of traditional Japanese stories and designs: peonies, koi, dragons, tenyo (she-angels), etc.</p>

                        <p>German born Alex Reinke is one of the only Europeans to be taken in as an apprentice from a Japanese craftsmen. He is the only apprentice of Horiyoshi III apart from his son Souryou Kazuyoshi and part of Horiyoshi III family. Alex is Horiyoshi’s second apprentice in the Yokohama studio (the first being his son) and the only Westerner fully trained in traditional 'tebori' methods. Tebori uses an instrument of bamboo and needles to manually drive ink into the skin and has been done the same way since late 18th century. According to Alex "The mystery involved in a Japanese tattoo is beyond Western comprehension as all the designs have deep philosophical meaning. They are heavy with messages of great virtue and portraits of the human condition, so important to the Japanese – to wear a Horimono or Irezumi [that’s a full body suit tattoo to you and I] shows character, personality and perseverance and the tattoo master is purveyor of all these things."</p>

                        <h2>Shige Iwasaki</h2>
                        <p>Shigenori Iwasaki, better known as 'Shige', is a world-renowned tattoo artist, known for his original take on classic Japanese tattoo styles. He is the owner of Yellow Blaze Tattoo Studio in Yokohama, which he operates with his wife Chisato.Shige was born in Hiroshima in 1970, and in early adulthood was making a living as a guitar teacher, with aspirations to become a musician. However his interests shifted, and he moved to Yokohama where he became a mechanic of Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Seeing the tattoos of the many bikers at close-hand led him to his calling as a tattoo artist. Completely self-taught, he started by tattooing his friends at night. Getting a tattoo in 2000 from French tattoo legend Philip Leu was a turning point, as he began to take tattooing seriously as an art-form. Shige eventually went to Switzerland for three months and got a full body-suit tattooed by Leu, which he considered to be a fantastic learning experience. He has cited his main influences as the Leu Family (especially Philip) and Horiyoshi III.Opening Yellow Blaze in 2000, Shige faced many obstacles. Being self-taught with no teacher, he didn't have the knowledge about the irezumi (Japanese tattoo) culture and tradition that is normal for a senior tattoo artist, and even received letters denouncing him. However he soon began to win fans and plaudits, going on to lift numerous awards at various international tattoo conventions. He continued to explore the boundaries of the tattoo art-form, while also exhibiting paintings, and published a self-titled art book in 2009. In the same year he also took on an apprentice Tomokazu Ikarashi, known as Tomo. Shige's standing in the tattoo world is evidenced by the rumored 2 year waiting list to get a Shige tattoo.</p>

                        <p>Female tattoo artist Asao is super friendly and down to earth, operating out of a small and clean studio in Shibuya. She tells us that she used to be a pattern maker in the fashion industry, and turned to tattooing after she got fired! She says a lot of her clients are female musicians, and she does get a lot of clients because they feel less threatened by her.While she can do any style, she does a lot of tribal – strong lines and shapes, but with a certain delicacy, and an undeniably Japanese aesthetic. She says she is conscious of her being Japanese and, accordingly, uses traditional Japanese motifs, and draws inspiration from Japanese art such as wood block prints. Her Black and Gray work is stunning.</p>

                        <h2>Horiyasu</h2>
                        <p>If large scale Japanese work is your cup of tea, then Horiyasu is one of Japan’s best. His work is flawless, but take note that he only specializes in Japanese work- no anchors or roses here! He is tucked away in an apartment in the Asakusa area. He requires advance notice and a Japanese translator who will make communication, although he is one of the most hospitable and genuinely lovely people in the Japanese tattoo industry. He is one of the most highly regarded Japanese masters, and is world renowned for his striking traditional pieces that are executed with a modern flare, having won numerous awards at conventions internationally. He will only take on large pieces, as traditional Japanese work is typically of a prolific size – although the end result will flow beautifully with the body. Horiyasu has one of the most fascinating backgrounds of any artist in the Japanese tattoo scene. Starting as a sword smith, after working on blades for 16 years, he changed his career at the age of 36. He quickly rose to the top, winning the respect of both old school tebori artists and modern street shop artists along the way.</p>
